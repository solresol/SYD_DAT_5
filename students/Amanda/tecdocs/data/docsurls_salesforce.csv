This is because mobile devices generally have less memory and screen size than computers and they do not maintain a constant network connection. To work with these limitations each mobile configuration only transfers data sets which are subsets of the records users access in the Salesforce online user interface. Mobile devices store data sets in on-board databases allowing users to access their most important records and work offline when no network connection is available. Salesforce automatically synchronizes the on-board databases when the mobile device reestablishes a network connection.Each data set can contain records related to a single object and is classified by the name of that object. For example the Accounts data set only includes account records.Data sets can have child data sets which are data sets that contain records associated with a top-level (parent) data set.

When you upgrade a package changes to the API access are ignored even if                     the developer specified them. This ensures that the administrator installing the                     upgrade has full control. Installers should carefully examine the changes in                     package access in each upgrade during installation and note all acceptable                     changes. Then because those changes are ignored the administrator should                     manually apply any acceptable changes after installing an upgrade.

This is especially helpful                     when debugging Apex logic.                     For example to evaluate the output of a complex process you can raise the log                     verbosity for a given class while turning off logging for other classes or                     triggers within a single request. When you override the debug log levels for a class or                 trigger these debug levels also apply to the class methods that your class or                 trigger calls and the triggers that get executed as a result. All class methods and                 triggers in the execution path inherit the debug log settings from their caller                 unless they have these settings overridden.

Salesforce allows a maximum of 10 unique relationships per object in cross-object formulas. The limit is cumulative across all formula fields rules and lookup filters. For example if two different formulas on opportunities reference two different fields of an associated account only one unique relationship exists (from opportunities to accounts).

A managed package is a collection of application components  that are posted as a unit on AppExchange and  are associated with a namespace and a License Management Organization.

The version number has the format                 majorNumber.minorNumber.patchNumber (for example 2.1.3). The               major and minor numbers increase to a chosen value during every major release. The                 patchNumber is generated and updated only for a patch               release. Unmanaged packages are not upgradeable so each package               version is simply a set of components for distribution. A package version has more               significance for managed packages. Packages can exhibit different behavior for               different versions. Publishers can use package versions to evolve the               components in their managed packages gracefully by releasing subsequent package               versions without breaking existing customer integrations using the package.,918,5224,About Package Versions,22,About Package Versions,22,,0,Salesforce Users,16,Marketing Cloud User?,21,,,,143441,579,8,7,11,31,6dd6b113da6396c7abb059d8b243f64,3.012,,https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=contacts_customer_portal.htm&language=en_US,text/html;charset=UTF-8,200,OK,Enable the Customer Portal for Contacts and Person Accounts,59,499,Salesforce.com Help Portal,26,218,"To allow a customer to access your Salesforce customer portal, enable the customer’s contact or person account record as a customer user.",137,818,Enable the Customer Portal for Contacts and Person Accounts,59,Enable the Customer Portal for Contacts and Person Accounts,59,,0,Salesforce Users,16,Marketing Cloud User?,21,,,,142873,483,10,10,17,29,955f28b19284501351fe463044cbebaf,3.373,,https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=apex_post_install_script_specify.htm&language=en_US,text/html;charset=UTF-8,200,OK,Specifying a Post Install Script,32,242,Salesforce.com Help Portal,26,218,Once you have created and tested the post install script you can specify it in the Post Install Script lookup field on the Package Detail page.

This enables you to sign on to                             Salesforce from a client application. Federated authentication using                         SAML is enabled by default for your organization. Delegated authentication single sign-on enables you to integrate Salesforce with an authentication method that you choose. This enables                         you to integrate authentication with your LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server or perform single                         sign-on by authenticating using a token instead of a password. You manage delegated authentication at the permission                         level allowing some users to use delegated authentication while other users continue,1000,5532,Best Practices for Implementing Single Sign-On,46,Best Practices for Implementing Single Sign-On,46,,0,Salesforce Users,16,Marketing Cloud User?,21,,,,158859,1622,7,8,11,34,e33f69060dd93b9871821114f15e954d,1.694,,https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=identityconnect_about.htm&language=en_US,text/html;charset=UTF-8,200,OK,About Identity Connect,22,182,Salesforce.com Help Portal,26,218,Identity Connect provides Active Directory integration.,55,313,About Identity Connect,22,About Identity Connect,22,,0,Salesforce Users,16,Marketing Cloud User?,21,,,,138632,291,8,7,13,30,a558a68588209d7500b640f0009e5f3a,2.106,,https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=sso_delauthentication.htm&language=en_US,text/html;charset=UTF-8,200,OK,Understanding Delegated Authentication Single Sign-On,53,449,Salesforce.com Help Portal,26,218,Salesforce uses the following process for authenticating users using delegated authentication single sign-on: When a user tries to log in—either online or using the API—Salesforce validates the username and checks the user’s permissions and access settings. If the user has the “Is Single Sign-On Enabled” user permission then Salesforce does not validate the username and password. Instead a Web services call is made to the user’s organization asking it to validate the username and password.Salesforce doesn’t store log or view the password in any way. It is disposed of immediately once the process is complete. The Web services call passes the username password and sourceIp to your Web service. (sourceIp is the IP address that originated the login request. You must create and deploy an implementation of the Web service that can be accessed by Salesforce servers.) Your implementation of the Web service validates the passed information and returns either true or false.

Duplicate ideas make it difficult to measure feedback because votes and comments are spread out over many similar ideas. The best way to resolve this issue is to merge duplicate ideas together so one idea becomes the master to one or more child ideas.Note the following about merging ideas. Once you merge ideas they cannot be separated. All votes belonging to child ideas are transferred to the master idea. If the same community member votes for two ideas that are eventually merged only the vote for the master idea is kept; the vote for the child idea is discarded. Users can only vote for and add comments to a master idea.  You cannot merge ideas in separate zones. Deleting a parent idea automatically deletes all child ideas. Child ideas cannot be deleted individually. The master idea does not inherit the status and category values of its child ideas.

Let’s say you periodically run sale offers for your paid users. If you drag all the sale pages into a special folder you mark for authorization they instantly inherit the folder’s setting. Users will need to log in to access them.

The number of employees is only available on records that have a value of Headquarters/Parent in the Account Site field. This means that a branch location may show a value of zero in the Employees field but still have a number of contacts. The Employees field on Account records shows the total number of employees within a company including all subsidiary and branch locations. The number of contacts however reflects only the contacts at that specific location. So a headquarters location that has 5000 employees throughout its various locations may only have 3000 contacts at the headquarters location. Employee totals come from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and usually do not include contract employees.

When modeling a many-to-many relationship you use a junction                                 object to connect the two objects you want to relate to each other.,654,3648,Create a Many-to-Many Relationship,34,Create a Many-to-Many Relationship,34,,0,Salesforce Users,16,Marketing Cloud User?,21,,,,155098,1364,7,11,18,29,386cc59d1eca66665a1e1dcf0065977,1.529,,https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=perm_sets_edit_list_views.htm&language=en_US,text/html;charset=UTF-8,200,OK,Create and Edit Permission Set List Views,41,337,Salesforce.com Help Portal,26,218,"You can create and edit permission set list views to show a list of permission sets with specific fields and permissions.
