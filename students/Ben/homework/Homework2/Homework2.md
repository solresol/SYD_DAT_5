# SYD DAT 5 Lab 2 - Visualisation and Regression

Make sure you have completed any labs that you might have missed or didn't finish.

##Homework - Due July 8th, 2016


* For the following use the github repository you made for your project. 
* Load some data you have gathered for your project into Python.
excel sheet, 

* Identify some numeric and categorical features in your data. Write this up in a file called README.md 
MVA, HV LV TV, temperature rise, Sound level, impedance_HV-LV, OLTC type, HV bushing, LV bushing, overload, no-load loss cost, load loss, quantity, TV_MVA 

Target price and load loss and no load loss

Force cooling influences the fan design 

Baseline analysis 

* Run some summary statistics over the numeric data.

mean of price for MVA 
mean MVA, HV, sound level 
standard deviation 
frequency of KV rating, OLTC, sound level
disperson of data 
range  
standard deviation
variance
coorelation
feature index 
interval
price difference 
Interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle fifty, or technically 
H-spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion,

set a baseline 

* Are there any interesting features of the data that jump out?
MVA, HV, LV, TV 

numerical limitation: of temperature rise, impedance, 

* Generate some data visualisations that would be useful for you to explore your data set, particularly the numeric data right now.

scatter plot 
histogram 
correlationship between OLTC type, MVA and price

many baseline plot - MVA vs HV-LV vs price,  HV-KV  

* If you can find any good candidates for a regression, try some regressors out.


* When you are ready to submit, create a branch in your repository.

* Send a message on Slack to Greg and Adrian to remind us of your repository name. Also tell us the name of the branch, and the filename of the jupyter notebook where you've done all this work
* (You can keep working on your project after this; Adrian and I will be looking at a static branch)
